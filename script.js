// Declare a new variable “myGrade” and assign a number value from 0-100 to it.

let myGrade = 88;

// Write an if/else-if/else statement that displays the letter grade using console.log(...) (A for 90+, B for 80-89, C for 70-79, D for 60-69, F for 59 and below)





// Modify the value inside of “myGrade” to test your code.


// What should go in your else statement?


// Write a switch statement that does the same thing as the if/else-if/else statement above. 


// Which do you prefer? Why?


// Which version of the code looks cleaner/easier to understand to you? Why?


// Write a for loop that prints all value from 1 to 100


// Modify your for loop to make it output an exclamation point for all odd numbers instead of the number.
